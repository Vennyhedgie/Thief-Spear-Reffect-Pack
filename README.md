# Thief-Spear-Reffect-Pack
A more visible UI element for Thief's Spear Weapon Mechanics

Helps keep track of the spear's combo chains, as well as Distracting Throw's uptime.

It's highly recommended to pair this pack with the thief stealth pack: https://github.com/Vennyhedgie/Thief-Stealth-Reffect-Pack

This pack comes with two options. Spear icons or simple icons:

Spear icons use the icons for slot 2 since they have generally more distinctive graphics, being animal themed:

Simple mode:

# How to use
First, download the zip file to your reffect root folder like so:

Then right click > Extract here (the necessary files will be added to the packs and icons subfolders).

Then, return to reffect ingame and refresh packs.

Finally, enable / disable whichever interface size and icon set you prefer:

# Note
I wanted to have this element centered over initiative, but because of the special action button, this would cause overlap when it appears, so by default it's out of the way. If you'd prefer to have it centered, despite it being covered when SAK appears, you can just move your interface of choice.

# Note
If you use the Thief Axe reffect pack, they will overlap, and you will have to move one of them out of the way. Since thief generally doesn't use two weapons actively due to how initiative works, it's up to you to choose which pack to use:
